# Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT)

The Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT) aims to provide tools for leveraging RNA-Seq to gain insights into the biology of cancer transcriptomes. Bioinformatics tool support is provided for mutation detection, fusion transcript identification, de novo transcript assembly of cancer-specific transcripts, lincRNA classification, and foreign transcript detection (viruses, microbes). CTAT is funded by the National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (NCI ITCR) program. CTAT software tools and pipelines are made available here and are most easily accessible for point-and-click execution via our Trinity CTAT Galaxy Portal: https://galaxy.ncgas-trinity.indiana.edu.
